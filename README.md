# OpenPortStom
A project that uses [weupnp](https://github.com/bitletorg/weupnp) to forward the port for you when starting your server, it will also attempt to close the port.

Yes this is a stupid name, I don't care.


NOTE: This won't work for all routers.

NOTE2: This is an <i>extension</i> for Minestom, use a server jar like [Sabre](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/Sabre) and put it into the extensions folder
